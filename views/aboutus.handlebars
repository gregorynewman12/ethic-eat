                <p>In the modern-day globalized food economy, it can be difficult to be aware of ethical concerns.
                    Consumers can select from hundreds of different food options every time they visit the supermarket,
                    and it is hard to keep track of issues such as which companies source their ingredients ethically,
                    raise their animals humanely, or treat their workers fairly. With the data available at our
                    fingertips in the information age, it should be easier for concerned individuals to make ethical
                    choices when they shop.

                    Our team's ethical eating application will empower consumers to select products from brands whose
                    morals align with theirs. The application should give the user a sense of satisfaction through the
                    knowledge that they are making smarter choices with the goods they buy and the brands they support.
